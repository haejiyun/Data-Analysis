# Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning Portfolio, where I showcase a collection of diverse projects demonstrating my expertise in various aspects of machine learning and deep learning. Each project presented here highlights my approach to tackling real-world problems using cutting-edge algorithms, extensive data processing, and thoughtful model evaluation. From socio-economic class prediction to detecting counterfeit bills and classifying images of Hollywood actresses, this portfolio provides a glimpse into the breadth and depth of my skills in both supervised and unsupervised learning.
