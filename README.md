- **[ML/DEEP] Multimodal data classification**<br/>
Codes : <br/>[EDA](https://github.com/haejiyun/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/1.%20Multimodal%20classification/1.%20EDA.ipynb)<br/>[Text classification](https://github.com/haejiyun/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/1.%20Multimodal%20classification/2.%20ML.ipynb)<br/>[Image classification](https://github.com/haejiyun/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/1.%20Multimodal%20classification/3.%20Deep.ipynb)<br/>
Large-scale product type code multimodal (text and image) classification. The goal is to predict each productâ€™s type code as defined in the catalog of Rakuten France. EDA, NLP, Machine Learning and Deep Learning were implemented to conduct the project. The project was presented through streamlit. - Challenge and data [link](https://challengedata.ens.fr/challenges/35)
